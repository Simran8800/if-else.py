# 1.Take user input in a variable named varx.
# 2.Convert it to an integer.
# 3. Check if this number is divisible by 2.
# You can achieve this by using the modulus operator``. Remember, modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of first operand by the second operand. Example:
# If the number is divisible by 2, print Divisible else print Not Divisible

# Create the flowchart and code and submit both of them.



# var_x=int(input("enter the number"))
# if  var_x%2==0:
#     print("divisible")
# else:
#     print("not divisible")
