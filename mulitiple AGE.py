# Create a flowchart that takes the age of the user as input. Print what all activitie
# the user can do from the list above. For example, if user enters age as 20, the code
# should print:



# var_y=int(input("enter the age"))
# if var_y>=25:
#     print("lagally drink")
# elif var_y>=24:
#     print("marry")
# elif var_y>=21:
#     print("drive a car")
# elif var_y>=18:
#     print("vote")
# elif var_y>=5:
#     print("school")
