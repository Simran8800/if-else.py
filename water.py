# if water in the filter is less than 9lthen more water needs to be filled. If the water 
# quantity is between 1L and 10L then there is no need to fill water. If water is more than
#  10L then the water will overflow. Based on these conditions, complete the flowchart given 
#  below.For water level, take user input in a variable named water and convert it to
#  an integer.


# var_1=int(input("enter the number"))
# if var_1<1:
#     print("more need to fill water")
# elif var_1>=1 and var_1<=10:
#         print("no need to filled the water")
# else:                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
#     print("overflo")






# room_1=int(int("enter the girls number"))
# if  room_1==12:
#     print(" equal hsi")
# elif 12<room_1:
#     print("more hai")
# else:
