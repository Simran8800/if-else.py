# Consider the example where we want to display the food menu based on the day and time. 
# For example on monday, "Poha" in breakfast, "Rajma Chawal" for lunch and "Roti Sabzi"
#  for dinner. Similary on tuesday, "Poori Sabzi" for breakfast, "Thukpa" for lunch and 
# "Chicken Chawal" for dinner. We can write a program for this question as shown below:-

# day=input("din enter kro")
# meal=input("meal enter kro, jaise breakfast lunch aur dinner main se ak")
# if day=="monday":
#     if meal=="breafast":
#         print("poha")
#     elif meal=="lunch":
#         print("rajma chawal")
#     else:
#         print("roti sabzi")
# elif day =="tuesday":
#     if meal=="breakfast":
#         print("poori sabzi")
#     elif meal=="lunch":
#         print("thukpa")
#     else:
#         print("chicken chawal")
# else:
#     print("kisi bhi din dal roti khayege")
